# Backlog

This folder is the source of truth for planning.

## Rules
- Tickets live in backlog/tickets as Markdown files.
- Backlog order lives in backlog/00_BACKLOG.md (top = highest priority).
- Each ticket file includes: title, type, priority, estimate, acceptance criteria, test plan.
- When priorities change, update 00_BACKLOG.md and the ticket metadata.

## Naming
Ticket file: YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md
Example: 2026-01-31-auth-refresh.md
